### 1. Usage guide
To run the file nothing special has to be done, just have the main .py file and the .txt file in the same directory
and run the .py file in any ide that you use

When you run the file you just have to follow what is said  on the terminal ,it all should be fairly self explanitory

### 2. Credit

they provided me with this programe.
